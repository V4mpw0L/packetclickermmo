# ðŸ”§ Avatar Fix Verification Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### 1. Code Review âœ…
- [ ] Firebase Storage API import includes `uploadBytes`
- [ ] Image compression pipeline is implemented in `main.js`
- [ ] Filename generation creates short, safe names
- [ ] Error handling provides proper fallbacks
- [ ] Size limits are appropriately set (2MB file, 200KB data URL, 100KB final)

### 2. Test File Functionality âœ…
- [ ] Open `avatar-fix-test.html` in browser
- [ ] All automated tests pass (Canvas API, FileReader, etc.)
- [ ] Upload test image and verify compression works
- [ ] Check that generated avatars are under 100KB
- [ ] Verify filename generation produces valid names

## Deployment Testing

### 3. Custom Avatar Upload Flow
- [ ] Navigate to Profile â†’ Edit Profile
- [ ] Click "Upload Picture" button
- [ ] Select an image file (test with different sizes/formats)
- [ ] Verify success message appears
- [ ] Check avatar appears in profile selection
- [ ] Save profile and verify avatar persists

### 4. Leaderboard Display
- [ ] Submit to leaderboard with custom avatar
- [ ] Verify avatar appears correctly in leaderboard list
- [ ] Check podium display shows custom avatar
- [ ] Confirm no console errors about invalid URLs
- [ ] Test with multiple users having custom avatars

### 5. Error Handling Verification
Test these scenarios should show appropriate warnings:
- [ ] Upload non-image file â†’ "Please upload an image file"
- [ ] Upload file > 2MB â†’ "Image too large (max 2MB)"
- [ ] Upload image that won't compress enough â†’ "Image still too large after compression"
- [ ] Verify fallback to default avatar when upload fails completely

### 6. Performance Verification
- [ ] Custom avatars load quickly (< 1 second)
- [ ] No browser lag when uploading/displaying avatars
- [ ] Leaderboard renders smoothly with multiple custom avatars
- [ ] Check browser dev tools for reasonable image sizes

### 7. Cross-Platform Testing
- [ ] Test on desktop Chrome/Firefox/Safari
- [ ] Test on mobile Chrome/Safari
- [ ] Verify avatars sync across devices
- [ ] Test with slow internet connection

## Technical Verification

### 8. Firebase Console Checks
- [ ] Check Firebase Storage for uploaded avatar files
- [ ] Verify filenames are short and properly formatted
- [ ] Confirm file sizes are reasonable (< 100KB typically)
- [ ] Check Firestore documents don't contain huge data URLs

### 9. Console Log Monitoring
Look for these success messages:
- [ ] `[Leaderboard] Avatar uploaded successfully:`
- [ ] `[Leaderboard] Avatar processed successfully: storage_url`
- [ ] `Avatar uploaded successfully!` (user notification)

Avoid these error patterns:
- [ ] No `net::ERR_INVALID_URL` errors
- [ ] No `Avatar failed to load` warnings for custom avatars
- [ ] No extremely long base64 strings in console

### 10. Database Efficiency
- [ ] Check Firestore document sizes are reasonable
- [ ] Verify avatar field contains URLs, not huge data strings
- [ ] Confirm leaderboard queries remain fast

## User Experience Validation

### 11. End-to-End User Journey
- [ ] New user uploads custom avatar â†’ works smoothly
- [ ] Existing user with old avatar uploads new one â†’ migrates correctly
- [ ] User sees their avatar in all game areas (top bar, profile, leaderboard)
- [ ] Other players see the custom avatar correctly

### 12. Edge Cases
- [ ] Very small images (< 10KB) â†’ should work fine
- [ ] Square vs rectangular images â†’ both resize properly
- [ ] Different image formats (PNG, JPEG, WebP) â†’ all supported
- [ ] Network interruption during upload â†’ graceful fallback

## Rollback Plan (if issues found)

### If Critical Issues Detected:
1. **Immediate**: Comment out the new upload logic in `main.js`
2. **Temporary**: Revert to previous version of `firebase.mjs`
3. **Investigation**: Use `avatar-fix-test.html` to debug issues
4. **Resolution**: Fix identified problems and re-test

### Known Safe Fallbacks:
- System will use default avatars if custom upload fails
- Existing custom avatars will continue working
- No user data should be lost

## Success Criteria âœ…

The fix is successful when:
- âœ… Custom avatars upload and display correctly
- âœ… No console errors about invalid URLs or huge data
- âœ… Avatar file sizes are under 100KB
- âœ… Upload process completes in < 5 seconds
- âœ… Leaderboard displays custom avatars properly
- âœ… Cross-device sync works correctly
- âœ… Performance remains smooth with multiple custom avatars

## Contact Info

If issues are found during testing:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Test with `avatar-fix-test.html` to isolate problems
3. Verify Firebase Storage configuration
4. Document specific error messages and reproduction steps
