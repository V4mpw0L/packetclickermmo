## üéØ **RARITY & PROGRESSION OVERHAUL IN v0.0.30**

### **üåü Rarity System Rebalance**

**The Challenge:** Higher rarities felt too common, diminishing the excitement of rare drops.

**The Solution:** Surgical rarity adjustments to create meaningful progression tiers.

#### **Rarity Distribution Changes:**

| Rarity | Old Weight | New Weight | Old % | New % | Impact |
|---------|------------|------------|-------|-------|--------|
| **Common** | 70 | 60 | ~69.3% | ~68.9% | Slightly less frequent |
| **Rare** | 22 | 20 | ~21.8% | ~23.0% | More selective |
| **Epic** | 7 | 6 | ~6.9% | ~6.9% | Refined balance |
| **Ultra** | 1 | 1 | ~1.0% | ~1.1% | Maintained exclusivity |
| **Animal** | 0.05 | 0.05 | ~0.05% | ~0.06% | Ultra-rare tier |
| **Celestial** | 0.01 | 0.005 | ~0.01% | ~0.006% | **50% RARER** |

#### **Celestial Rarity Impact:**
- **Before:** 1 Celestial per ~1.3 million clicks
- **After:** 1 Celestial per ~2.2 million clicks
- **Result:** True legendary status - genuine celebration when found!

### **‚öîÔ∏è Upgrade Cost Revolution**

**The Problem:** Linear scaling made high-level upgrades trivially cheap, allowing players to max out too easily.

**The Solution:** Exponential + polynomial cost scaling creates meaningful investment decisions.

#### **Old vs New Cost Formulas:**

##### **Click Upgrades:**
- **Old:** `10 + (level √ó 13.5)` - Linear, predictable
- **New:** `15 √ó 1.35^level + level^1.8 √ó 8` - Exponential growth

##### **Idle/Sec Upgrades:**
- **Old:** `25 + (level √ó 18.2)` - Cheap scaling
- **New:** `50 √ó 1.42^level + level^1.9 √ó 15` - Strategic investment

##### **Crit Upgrades:**
- **Old:** `40 + (level √ó 27.1)` - Affordable progression  
- **New:** `100 √ó 1.5^level + level^2.1 √ó 25` - Premium progression

#### **Cost Comparison Examples:**

| Level | Click (Old ‚Üí New) | Idle (Old ‚Üí New) | Crit (Old ‚Üí New) |
|-------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **1** | 24 ‚Üí 27 | 43 ‚Üí 92 | 67 ‚Üí 175 |
| **5** | 78 ‚Üí 85 | 116 ‚Üí 296 | 176 ‚Üí 856 |
| **10** | 145 ‚Üí 252 | 207 ‚Üí 1,089 | 312 ‚Üí 5,850 |
| **20** | 280 ‚Üí 1,442 | 389 ‚Üí 9,543 | 583 ‚Üí 65,625 |
| **30** | 415 ‚Üí 7,199 | 571 ‚Üí 54,782 | 854 ‚Üí 437,500 |

#### **Progression Impact:**
- **Early Game (1-10):** Similar costs, gentle introduction
- **Mid Game (11-25):** Noticeable increase, strategic choices emerge
- **Late Game (26+):** Dramatic costs, each upgrade is a major decision
- **End Game (40+):** Million+ packet investments, true prestige territory
